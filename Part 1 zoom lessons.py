# # # print function
# print(f"Hello world!")
# 2# Always use dubbel quotes- so u can use single quotes in a string like for a sentence
# # integer is a whole number
# # and everthing with a decimal behind the number it becomes a float
# print(f"First line, \nSecond line,")
# print(f"Third line.")

# print(f"First line.")
# print(f"\nThird line.")

# # print(f"""")

# PEP 8 Conventions
# indentation's needs to be Consistent
# Limit the code lines to a maximum of 79 characters.
# You can limit the character's by changing the settings in your coding editor.

#Giving function's a different name: 
# different_name  = print
# different_name(f"Hellow world!")

# Variables

# name_var = "Max"
# age_var = 23
# weight_in_kg = 75.5

# print(f"Hello!, My name is {name_var}, I'm {age_var} years old.\nand I weight {weight_in_kg} Kg.")

# Do not use specifiek keywords that act as functions in your variable name. according to the pep8 conventions.

# If u decide to make a var name, try to use 3 word names with underscore connecting it. as spaces would the editor consider it as every word is it's own independent var. so like this name_var or avg_data_age.

# Naming variable's exercise
# rotten_fruits_numb = # amount of rotten fruits.
# prime_numb_lst = # the list of prime numbers.
# math_exam_scores = # the list of mathematix exam scores.

# Exercise
# January = March = May = July = August = October = December = 31
# April = June = September = November = 30
# February = 28

# print(January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December)

# When there is no value asigned to a variable or you dont know for now, you could asign it to be temporarly or permananently "None" value without the quotations marks. depending on the situation.
