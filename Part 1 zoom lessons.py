# # # print function
# print(f"Hello world!")
# 2# Always use dubbel quotes- so u can use single quotes in a string like for a sentence
# # integer is a whole number
# # and everthing with a decimal behind the number it becomes a float

# print(f"Third line.")

# print(f"First line.")

# PEP 8 Conventions
# indentation's needs to be Consistent
# Limit the code lines to a maximum of 79 characters.
# You can limit the character's by changing the settings in your coding editor.

#Giving function's a different name: 
# different_name  = print
# different_name(f"Hellow world!")

# Variables

# name_var = "Max"
# age_var = 23
# weight_in_kg = 75.5

# print(f"Hello!, My name is {name_var}, I'm {age_var} years old.\nand I weight {weight_in_kg} Kg.")

# Do not use specifiek keywords that act as functions in your variable name. according to the pep8 conventions.

# If u decide to make a var name, try to use 3 word names with underscore connecting it. as spaces would the editor consider it as every word is it's own independent var. so like this name_var or avg_data_age.

# Naming variable's exercise
# rotten_fruits_numb = # amount of rotten fruits.
# prime_numb_lst = # the list of prime numbers.
# math_exam_scores = # the list of mathematix exam scores.

# Exercise
# January = March = May = July = August = October = December = 31
# April = June = September = November = 30
# February = 28

# print(January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December)

# When there is no value asigned to a variable or you dont know for now, you could asign it to be temporarly or permananently "None" value without the quotations marks. depending on the situation.

# Basic Data Types
# String 
# Integer
# Float
# Boolean

# email_adres = "alfred@clarusway.com"
# id_numb = "632"
# secret_course_paswrd = "It's early"

# print(f"The e-mail adres is: {email_adres}, with the id number of {id_numb}, and the secret password is:{secret_course_paswrd}.")

# str_number = "1923"
# str_sign = "&(*^#$"

# print(str_number)
# print(str_sign)
# print(type(str_number), type(str_sign))

# integer are whole numbers, it could be negative.
# floats has numbers with decimals, usualy its better to store a vulue in whole numbers if there is no decimal.
# 
# Boolean False or True

# prime = 7
# primes =  [3, 7, 11, 13, 23, 101]
# is_prime = prime in primes

# print(is_prime)

# so in this situations it is true that there is prime in primes list, essentialy its asking when you are asking to print, to print if its true that 7 is in the list of primes. and as you can see in the terminal is say true because there is a 7 in the list. and true is thus the boolean value.

# Type conversion
# converting data types.

# you can use these following to convert Datatypes:
# - str() converts to string type.
# - int() converts to integer type.
# - float() converts to floating type.

# able to convert string number into int or float.

# The value of any type in python can be converted to a string. except for exceptions.

# when a float var is converted to a int var ALL the deciamals will be erased of which means anynumber behind the whole number gets erased. 2.36341234534 would become 2, 5.9998877 would become 5.

# and when a int becomes a float it will add one zero of decimal if there is no existing decimal. 5 would become 5.0 and 42 would become 42.0

# you cant add a int and a string togheter or you would get a error, even if the string consist only of whole numbers. so first convert the string to int, before you do a mathmatical handeling with a integer(int)
